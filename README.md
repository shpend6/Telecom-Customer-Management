# CRM-DDS
This is a Customer Relational Management Java app done for the OOP course in the LIFE program 2nd edition, taught by professor Fatos Maxhuni. 
The app uses Postgresql to save the data.
The app defines the entities in a CRM system, such as: Customer, Contract, Contact, Subscription, Product, and Services.
It also defines controllers to allow admins to create, read, update, and delete data from and into the database.
It doesn't have a GUI yet.
